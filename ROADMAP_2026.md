# OneMetro — Strategic Roadmap 2026

## 🌟 Vision Recap
OneMetro is the fastest, most aesthetic transit portal for India. We are moving from a "Metro Map" to a "Universal Urban Mobility Platform."

---

## 📍 Where We Are
- **20 Cities** integrated with high-quality SVG maps.
- **Sub-1-second** load times.
- **Framework-less** Vanilla JS architecture.

## 🚀 The Future: Roadmap 2026

### 🚆 Phase 1: Expansion & Completeness
Bringing every network to its full "future" state.
- **Delhi & Hyderabad Expansion**: Calculate and render upcoming/under-construction lines for the largest networks.
- **RRTS Integration**: First-class support for the Delhi-Meerut RRTS and regional corridors.
- **Construction Hub**: Data for Surat, Patna, and Navi Mumbai (Operational vs Under-construction differentiation).

### 🔍 Phase 2: UX Revolution
As we grow past 20 cities, navigation must evolve.
- **Smart Landing Page Search**: A fuzzy-search bar for the landing page to quickly jump to any city or line.
- **Responsive Grid**: Redesigning the landing page for a dense, searchable city list.

### 🕒 Phase 3: Temporal Intelligence
Understanding *when* the trains run.
- **Static Schedule Engine**: Pre-calculating first/last train times and peak frequency from static data modules.
- **Real-world Timing**: Adding "Operational Since" and "Frequency" metadata to every line component.

### 🌏 Phase 4: The "Indian" Web
- **Localization Engine**: Multi-language support (Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, etc.) across the entire interface.
- **Phonetic Station Search**: Search for stations in local scripts.

### ⚙️ Phase 5: The Ingestion Engine (Automation)
Moving from manual research to automated data updates.
- **Scripted Scrapers**: Developing a suite of reliable scripts (Node/Python) to fetch station, line, schedule, and fare data from official sources.
- **Transformation Pipeline**: Automatically converting raw source data into OneMetro's standardized static JS modules.

### 📱 Phase 6: Multi-Platform Core
Taking OneMetro to the pocket.
- **PWA Excellence**: Full offline support for commuters in basements/tunnels.
- **App Conversion**: Exploring **Capacitor** or **Cordova** to wrap OneMetro into native Android and iOS apps.

### ☕ Phase 7: Sustainability & Community
- **Support OneMetro**: Integrated "Buy me a coffee" and Sponsorship buttons for enthusiasts.
- **Open Source Growth**: Improved `CONTRIBUTING.md` for data hobbyists.

## 🛠️ Next Immediate Steps
1.  **Search**: Implement fuzzy search on the Landing Page.
2.  **Expansion**: Research "Upcoming" line coordinates for Delhi Phase 4 and Hyderabad Phase 2.
3.  **Automation**: Define the scraper architecture.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> OneMetro will remain **Open Source** and **Free Forever**.
